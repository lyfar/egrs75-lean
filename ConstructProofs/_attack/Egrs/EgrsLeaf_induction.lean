EGRS75 two-prime ALIGN leaf — route "induction": isolate the single irreducible
carry-control step behind a clean strong-induction skeleton.

TARGET (verbatim, = `Fromscratch.digit_repair_align`, = the prompt's ALIGN,
= the ENTIRE remaining gap of the EGRS two-prime theorem):

  for distinct odd primes `p q` and every `N`,
    `∃ n, N < n ∧ LowDigits p n ∧ LowDigits q n`.

The crux is PROVEN EQUIVALENT to this statement kernel-clean (`CruxClose.crux_iff_align`),
and the whole EGRS two-prime divisibility target closes from it via the kernel-clean
bridge `EgrsAll.egrs_two_prime_of_crux`.  So `align_induction` below is the single
remaining mathematical object.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT THIS FILE DOES (over the bare `sorry` in `Equidist_fromscratch`):

It REIFIES the EGRS75 digit-clearing construction as an explicit STRONG INDUCTION
on a termination potential (`badCountQ p q n` = number of base-`q` digits of `n`
that exceed `(q-1)/2`), and proves EVERY part of the scaffold kernel-clean EXCEPT
the single carry-control inductive step.  Concretely:

  * `badDigitsQ`, `badCountQ`  — the potential (count of oversized base-`q` digits).
  * `badCountQ_eq_zero_iff_lowDigits`  — potential `= 0`  ↔  `LowDigits q n`
      (KERNEL-CLEAN).  This is the base case of the induction: when no base-`q`
      digit is oversized, the number is already `LowDigits q`.
  * `align_of_repair`  — GIVEN the repair step (`repair_step`, the one `sorry`),
      ALIGN follows by strong induction on the potential, seeded by `p^a`
      (`LowDigits p` for free) pushed past `N`.  This reduction is KERNEL-CLEAN
      (it consumes `repair_step` as a hypothesis, proves nothing false).
  * `seed_lowDigits_pow` / `seed_lt_pow_succ`  — the seed `p^(N+1)` is `LowDigits p`
      for free and exceeds `N` (KERNEL-CLEAN; proven inline so this file imports only
      kernel-clean material, no upstream `sorry`).
  * `align_induction`  — the target, obtained by discharging `repair_step` with the
      single labelled `sorry`.

THE SINGLE LABELLED `sorry` (`repair_step`) is EXACTLY the EGRS75 carry-control
lemma, stated precisely:

  if `n` is `LowDigits p` and has at least one oversized base-`q` digit, then there
  is `n' > n` that is STILL `LowDigits p`, has STRICTLY fewer oversized base-`q`
  digits, and does not regrow the already-cleared higher base-`q` digits.

This is the step Bloom–Croot (arXiv:2509.02835, §1, slug
`bloom-croot-integers-with-small-digits-in-multiple-bases-arx`) describe and then
defer VERBATIM: "It is not immediately obvious, of course, that one can remove a
large base 5 digit without creating large base 3 digits.  That this is always
possible is proved using elementary number theory in [4] (and makes essential use
of the condition (3))."  The original EGRS75 [4] (Math. Comp. 29 (1975)) is the
multi-page elementary argument; it is NOT in the corpus (only Bloom–Croot's sketch
+ worked p=3/q=5 example + explicit deferral), and Mathlib packages neither it nor
the effective equidistribution of `{a·log p mod log q}` that an analytic proof would
need (only the qualitative `AddCircle.denseRange_zsmul_coe_iff`).  So `repair_step`
is the genuinely-hardest, source-confirmed-irreducible step, and it carries the ONE
`sorry`.

NO fakes: no `native_decide`, no `axiom`, no `implemented_by`, no circular
hypothesis.  Everything other than `repair_step` is kernel-clean.  Pre-existing
clean files are NOT modified.  This formalizes the KNOWN theorem EGRS75
(Math. Comp. 1975, Thm 2 / Bloom–Croot Thm 2); three primes is Erdős #376, OPEN —
not attempted here.

/-! ## Seed facts (KERNEL-CLEAN, proven inline to avoid importing any sorry-carrying file)

The seed of the EGRS construction is a power `p^a`, which is `LowDigits p` for free
and exceeds any `N` for `a = N+1`.  Both facts are elementary; we prove them here
(rather than importing `EgrsCrux_Cdensity`, which carries its own upstream `sorry`)
so this file imports only kernel-clean material. -/

/-! ## The termination potential: count of oversized base-`q` digits

`badCountQ p q n` counts how many base-`q` digits of `n` exceed `(q-1)/2`.  It is
`0` exactly when `n` is `LowDigits q`, and it is the EGRS construction's termination
measure: each repair step strictly decreases it while preserving `LowDigits p`. -/

def badDigitsQ (q n : ℕ) : List ℕ :=

potential: `0` iff `LowDigits q n`, strictly decreased by each repair step. -/
def badCountQ (q n : ℕ) : ℕ := (badDigitsQ q n).length

/-- **Base case of the induction (KERNEL-CLEAN).**  The potential vanishes exactly
when every base-`q` digit is `≤ (q-1)/2`, i.e. when `n` is `LowDigits q`.  So a
number with potential `0` is already low in base `q`. -/

/-! ## The single irreducible step: EGRS carry-controlled repair (THE GAP)

`repair_step` is the EGRS75 ($r=2$) carry-control lemma — the precise statement of
"remove a large base-`q` digit without creating a large base-`p` digit, and without
regrowing already-cleared higher base-`q` digits".  It is the ONE labelled `sorry`. -/

/-- **THE GAP (one labelled `sorry`): the EGRS carry-controlled repair step.**

If `n` is `LowDigits p` and has at least one oversized base-`q` digit
(`0 < badCountQ q n`), then there is a STRICTLY LARGER number `n' > n` that is

  * still `LowDigits p` (no large base-`p` digit was created), and
  * has STRICTLY fewer oversized base-`q` digits (`badCountQ q n' < badCountQ q n`).

This is exactly the EGRS75 repair Lemma (Math. Comp. 29 (1975), Thm 2, case
`κ₁ = κ₂ = 1/2`, so condition (3) `(p-1)/2/(p-1) + (q-1)/2/(q-1) = 1` holds at
equality).  The construction adds a controlled `LowDigits p` correction (drawn from
`RoundUp.exists_lowDigits_between`) positioned at the oversized base-`q` digit; the
content — and the gap — is that this can always be done WITHOUT regrowing base-`p`
or higher base-`q` digits, which "makes essential use of the condition (3)"
(Bloom–Croot §1).  Source-confirmed irreducible with current Mathlib (no effective
equidistribution; original EGRS75 [4] not in corpus).  See file header. -/

/-! ## The reduction: ALIGN from the repair step, by strong induction on the potential

GIVEN `repair_step`, ALIGN follows: seed `p^a` (`LowDigits p` for free, and `> N`
for large `a`), then run the repair step until the potential hits `0`, at which point
`badCountQ_eq_zero_iff_lowDigits` certifies the result is `LowDigits q` too.  The
strict decrease of `badCountQ` gives well-foundedness.  This whole reduction is
KERNEL-CLEAN — it consumes `repair_step` (the only `sorry`) and proves nothing false. -/

/-- **Reduction (FULLY KERNEL-CLEAN).**  The repair step is taken here as an EXPLICIT
hypothesis `hrepair` (the abstract EGRS carry-control property), so this lemma proves
NOTHING unproven — it is the pure logical reduction "iterate a potential-decreasing,
`LowDigits p`-preserving, strictly-increasing repair until the base-`q` potential is
`0`, where `badCountQ_eq_zero_iff_lowDigits` certifies `LowDigits q`".

From a `LowDigits p` seed strictly above `N`, repeatedly applying `hrepair` drives the
base-`q` potential to `0`, yielding a number that is `> N`, `LowDigits p`, and
`LowDigits q`.  Strong induction on the potential `badCountQ q` of the running number.
KERNEL-CLEAN (no `sorry`, no axioms beyond propext/Classical.choice/Quot.sound);
`align_induction` supplies the concrete `hrepair := repair_step` (the one `sorry`). -/

/-! ## The target: ALIGN, with the single `sorry` discharged via `repair_step`

Seed `p^(N+1)`: it is `LowDigits p` for free (`Cdensity.lowDigits_pow`, needs `p ≥ 3`,
which holds for an odd prime) and exceeds `N` (`Cdensity.lt_pow_succ`).  Feeding it to
`align_of_repair` discharges ALIGN.  The whole thing inherits exactly the one
`repair_step` `sorryAx`. -/

/-- **ALIGN (the target).**  Statement-identical to `Fromscratch.digit_repair_align`
and the prompt's ALIGN — the ENTIRE remaining gap of the EGRS two-prime theorem.

Obtained by the kernel-clean induction skeleton `align_of_repair` seeded with `p^(N+1)`
(`LowDigits p` for free, `> N`), discharging the single irreducible carry-control step
`repair_step` with the ONE labelled `sorry`.  Everything other than `repair_step`
— the potential, its base case, the strong-induction reduction, and the seed — is
kernel-clean.  Inherits exactly the single `repair_step` `sorryAx`. -/
